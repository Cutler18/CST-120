            <h2>Growing Up</h2>
            <!--First section paragraph-->
            <p>
                I was born in Sunvalley, Idaho in October of 1996. From there, I was taken to our<br />
                family ranch in the Phasimeroi Valley in the center of Idaho. The ranch was about<br />
                1300 acres in size and consisted of multiple hay fields, a large pasture, corrals,<br />
                and a calving barn. A calving barn is simply a small barn used to help cows give<br />
                birth to new calves. Living on a ranch that size involved a lot of playing outside<br />
                and a lot of work. I learned how to drive a stick shift truck by the time I was 7<br />
                years old. Before that, my dad would put his Dodge Cummins truck in 4-Low and let it<br />
                crawl through the pasture while I steered and he threw hay to the cows from the bed.<br />
                Eventually I learned to work the clutch and shifter and was able to drive the truck<br />
                around the ranch whenever he needed me to. The town I lived in was called May and my<br />
                family was half the population of that small town. I was fortunate to grow up the way<br />
                I did. I learned the value of hard work and effort. My dad taught me traditional values<br />
                that live inside of me to this day. My mom says me and my siblings were 'feral' children<br />
                because we had a lack of supervision at the ranch, but fortunately all 8 of us made it<br />
                out alive, but not without a few scars. At the age of 9 I had an unfortunate run-in<br />
                with a door, that is my sister kicked it and the handle pinched my finger against a<br />
                concrete wall, and the top part of my right ring finger was cut off. I also have scars<br />
                from dog attacks, cat attacks, and even hitting my head against a rock a time or two.<br />
                When I was 11 years old, we sold that house and the land because of my dad's health<br />
                concerns. He was type-1 diabetic and was degrading in his health fairly quickly. We<br />
                moved to Challis, Idaho which was an hour and a half from the original ranch, but put<br />
                us within 15 minutes of my Grandparents, my Dad's mother and father. From that point<br />
                on I was raised on a 90 acre ranch. I spent my spare time in all levels of school<br />
                wrestling. Once I reached Middle School I added football to my list of activities.<br />
                I even attempted to run track at the end of my sophomore year, but a combination of<br />
                oversized cleats and a teammate that couldn't seem to put the baton into my hand<br />
                properly resulted in a tumble that left my shoulder dislocated with a torn tendon<br />
                that would require surgery. None the less I went on to play football just a few months<br />
                later. I was a varsity football player and varsity wrestler for the entirety of my<br />
                high school career and never attempted any other sports after my track running<br />
                incident. That leads me to graduation. I wasn't the most academically proficient<br />
                student, but I graduated either way and went on to the next phase of my life.<br />

            <h2>After Graduation</h2>
            <!--Second section paragraph-->
            <p>
                Immediately upon graduation I moved out of my Dad's house and got an apartment with one<br />
                of my older brothers. I also got a job at the same company as that brother making work<br />
                commutes easy. I worked at a metal fabrication and powder coating company that built and<br />
                delivered products across the United States. We made products such as metal benches, picnic<br />
                tables, garbage can covers (like those used at parks), and even dumpsters. The company<br />
                also allowed people to bring in products to be sandblasted and powder coated. When I first<br />
                started there I was a general worker. I swept floors, cleaned up scrap metal, and from time<br />
                to time I got to help the welders with a few projects. I was fortunate to learn how to<br />
                operate a break press for bending metal pieces and because of my background on a cattle<br />
                ranch I already knew how to weld. I didn't get to do any large welding products because<br />
                I was never certified to do so, but they let me help them anyway. For the last month of<br />
                my employment there I was moved to the night shift as a sandblaster. That was a fun job.<br />
                I got to spend the entire night inside of the sandblasting room in a protective suit shooting<br />
                pressurized sand at pieces of metal, such as metal doors, car pieces, and little pieces<br />
                used in our own products. While I did enjoy this job I felt like I needed to move onto<br />
                something else. I contacted a local Marine Corps recruiter and within a couple of months<br />
                I was shipping of to San Diego to become a US Marine. I rode in an airplane for the first<br />
                time that I can remember and landed in the San Diego airport. I spent several hours waiting<br />
                for a drill instructor to come and get me along with the other hundreds of young men who<br />
                were there to become Marines. Finally, the time came and he arrived. We were taken to MCRD<br />
                San Diego where we were trained to become Marines. After bootcamp I was shipped to Camp<br />
                Pendleton where I underwent Marine Combat Training for a month. Then it was to Fort<br />
                Leanordwood to learn how to do my assigned job as a motor vehicle operator. I spent<br />
                the first year of my fleet assignment after Fort Leanordwood at Camp Fuji, Japan.<br />
                I then spent the last of my time in the Marine Corps in Yuma, Arizona. While in Yuma<br />
                I met my wife. We got married shortly after I was discharged from the Marines and<br />
                moved back to Challis, Idaho. Back in Challis I began to work as an underground miner<br />
                with a couple of my other brothers and a family friend. I learned to operate a jack<br />
                leg, an underground loader, a surface loader, and even learned how to use dynamite.<br />
                From there I took my wife and young daughter to Idaho Falls, Idaho where I started<br />
                college for the first time. At this point I was already 23 years old and most of my<br />
                former high school class mates were already finished with their college careers, but<br />
                that wasn't going to stop me from going forward with it. I only spent a year in Idaho<br />
                Falls before moving back to Yuma so my wife could be closer to her family. I had only<br />
                completed one semester at BYU-Idaho at this point. I finished another semester online<br />
                before dropping my classes and moving on. In Yuma, I worked as a security officer for<br />
                a local casino. While working at the casino my oldest son was born and welcomed into<br />
                my young family. My time at the casino was cut short because of an outbreak of Covid<br />
                that resulted in the casino shutting down for some time. This put me into a difficult<br />
                position and forced me to look for employment elsewhere. That is when I found my current<br />
                job that leads me into my most recent phase of life.<br />

            <h2>Where I am Now</h2>
            <!--Third section paragraph-->
            <p>
                For 5 years I dedicated my career to the Arizona Department of Corrections while working<br />
                as a Correctional Officer at the Lewis Complex in Buckeye, Arizona and most recently in<br />
                the Yuma Complex in San Luis, Arizona. I spent 7 weeks in a training academy for the<br />
                Department of Corrections where I learned how to be a Correctional Officer. It may not<br />
                have given quite the challenge that Marine Corps bootcamp did, but it was a good experience<br />
                that helped me to gain the knowledge I needed to work within an Arizona prison. Once I<br />
                completed the academy I was assigned to the Lewis Complex. I spent 5 months working at<br />
                the Barchey unit which is a medium custody protective custody unit. I commuted 2 hours<br />
                every day to get to the unit, worked 12 hours in the day, then drove the two hours back<br />
                home. I was then transferred to the Yuma complex where my commute was shortened to only<br />
                20 minutes. I served at the Yuma complex for the next 4 1/2 years. While there I was able<br />
                to work at every custody level available at the complex, which are minimum, medium, and<br />
                close custodies. I was able to work within a detention unit, or as it's commonly known<br />
                'the hole'. I thrived and was well recognized by my supervisors for my hard work and<br />
                strong adaptability. I credit both the Marine Corps and my upbringing for my ability to<br />
                adapt and put in my best effort. I started attending college again during this time and<br />
                completed my Associate's in Computer Science at the end of 2024. I then enrolled with<br />
                Grand Canyon University for Software Development. This is where I am currently studying<br />
                in hopes to recieve my Bachelor's. In 2024, while living in Yuma and working at the Yuma<br />
                complex, I received an upsetting phone call. My Dad, who has battled severe health issues<br />
                his whole life, was in the ICU in Salt Lake City. He had been in and out of the hospital<br />
                including the ICU many times in his life, but this time was different. I drove the 10<br />
                hours to Salt Lake City on my own because my wife was attending my daughter's end of<br />
                the year ballet recital. While driving, I decided a prayer would be the best thing I<br />
                could do at that time. I still felt as though my Dad would simply get better and go<br />
                home as he had done many times in his life, but I prayed anyway. In my lengthy prayer<br />
                I told God that if He would be willing to preserve my Dad's life long enough for me to<br />
                see him one more time I would be greatful, but I also prayed that if God decided to take<br />
                him before I got there I would still be greatful because my Dad would no longer be in pain.<br />
                Fast forward a few hours, I was only 10 minutes away from the hospital and I received<br />
                the phone call that I never wanted. My brother called with a shaky voice and told me that<br />
                my Dad had passed away. He went into cardiac arrest and because of his DNR, they wouldn't<br />
                do CPR on him. I immediately fell into deep despair. I had never felt that kind of desperate<br />
                pain before. I began yelling and cursing, blaming God for not preserving his life for 10<br />
                more minutes and wait for me to get there. After a minute I remembered my prayer and<br />
                apologized to God for my outburst, but I couldn't get rid of the desperate pain that<br />
                I felt. My eyes were blurry and my mind was racing. My body was shaking and I was afraid<br />
                that I was going to crash my car driving 75 miles per hour down the freeway. I prayed<br />
                again that God would calm me so I could arrive to the hospital safely. Immediately my<br />
                mind was clear, my vision was clear, and my body was still. I didn't feel peace of comfort<br />
                only pure focus. As soon as my focus cleared I heard a voice in my head that told me I<br />
                would see my Dad before he died. This confused me because there is no reason I should<br />
                let a thought like that cross my mind. It's only later that I realized it was the voice<br />
                of God that told me I would see my Dad. Within a minute of hearing that voice tell me<br />
                I would see my dad once more before his death, my brother called me again. He said, "I <br />
                don't know why or how, but Dad is alive." He continued to explain that as they were<br />
                mourning over my Dad's body, his heart randomly began beating again, and he began<br />
                breathing again. As my brother hung up the phone after telling me to drive safe, I felt<br />
                a loving holy presence unlike any I have ever felt before. I began to weep with joy<br />
                as I felt God wrap his arms around me in love. I was blessed to be able to spend a day<br />
                and half with my Dad before God called him home. I drove the 10 hours home after taking a<br />
                day to mourn with my family. I picked up my wife and two children and drove to Idaho for<br />
                the funeral. We buried my Dad on my Grandpa's ranch and spent time celebrating the great<br />
                life that he lived. A few months later my second son was born. This was a joyous and<br />
                concerning time. My youngest son, as we learned shortly later, was born with a very rare<br />
                genetic mutation that causes an overgrowth in several limbs and in his brain. He is prone<br />
                to seizures and has severe developmental delays. It has been a long process in taking<br />
                care of this young man, but I know that God has blessed us with the life of that young man.<br />
                We will continue having faithing and trusting in God as we continue forward in this life.
