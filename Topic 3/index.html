      <h2>Advanced Web Development</h2>
      <!--Week 7 Description-->
      <p>
        In this topic, students learn that static webpages have their limits and
        that they often need to be deployed on web servers sometimes backed with
        a server-side programming language or database. This topic, at minimum,
        will introduce students to the HTTP protocol, the client server model,
        HTML forms, and how to implement forms processing to expand on the
        capabilities of the webpages they have built in previous topics. Lastly,
        students are introduced to the basic concepts required for future web
        application development courses where formal dynamic web application
        frameworks are used.
      </p>
      <!--Week 7 Objectives-->
      <ol>
        <li>Investigate HTTP protocol and the client server model.</li>
